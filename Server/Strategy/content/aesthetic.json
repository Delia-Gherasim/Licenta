      "title": "What is Composition?",
      "description": "In photography, composition refers to the way visual elements are arranged within the frame. Unlike traditional visual arts, photography relies heavily on the recognizability of subjects, which can become symbols in their own right. A good composition directs the viewer's eye and helps communicate meaning or emotion effectively.",
      "concepts": {
        "Rule of Thirds": {
          "description": "This classic technique divides the frame into nine equal sections using two vertical and two horizontal lines. Placing key subjects along these lines or their intersections creates a balanced, visually pleasing photo.",
          "details": "Used in everything from portraits to landscapes, the rule of thirds helps naturally guide the viewer’s attention. Compositions can also incorporate triangular arrangements, which add harmony and structure.",

        "Leading Lines": {
          "description": "Leading lines are elements within the photo that draw the viewer’s eye to the main subject or through the scene.",
          "details": "These lines can be roads, fences, rivers, or even shadows. Diagonal lines, in particular, add a dynamic, forward-moving energy. They help create a sense of motion or guide the narrative of the photo.",

        "Symmetry and Patterns": {
          "description": "Symmetry and repetition offer a sense of harmony, order, and visual appeal.",
          "details": "Horizontal, vertical, or radial symmetry creates balance, while repeating shapes or forms create rhythm and structure. These elements often result in clean, impactful photographs.",

          "description": "Framing uses elements in the scene to create a visual frame around the subject, drawing attention and adding depth.",
          "details": "Windows, arches, tree branches, or even light and shadows can serve as frames, guiding the viewer’s focus and enhancing the image’s story.",

          "description": "Negative space refers to the empty or unoccupied areas around the subject.",

          "description": "Balance involves arranging elements so that no part of the image feels heavier or out of proportion.",
